HOW TO LAUNCH A PROGRAM ON VPN CONNECTION AND CLOSE IT ON DISCONNECT
---------------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions use the provided connected.sh, post-disconnect.sh, and reconnecting.sh scripts. The scripts must be modified to indicate the desired application, and connected.sh must also indicate the logged-in username. 

For example, to launch Transmission on connection, change the command in connected.sh from

sudo -u USERNAME open /path/to/application.app/

to 

sudo -u myusername open /Applications/Transmission.app/

Similarly, to close Transmission on disconnect, in post-disconnect.sh and reconnecting.sh, change the kill process command from

pkill application

to

pkill Transmission

To create an installable Tunnelblick VPN connection file that launches the program on connection and closes the program on disconnect:

1. Create folder with desired VPN name.

2. Put the .ovpn file (with same name as the folder) in the folder.

3. Put the scripts into the folder:
- connected.sh (runs when VPN is connected)
- post-disconnect.sh (runs when VPN is disconnected)
- reconnecting.sh (runs when VPN is trying to re-connect)

4. Rename the folder to have a .tblk extension.

5. Double-click the new .tblk file to install it into Tunnelblick.
